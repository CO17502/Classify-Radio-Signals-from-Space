# Classify-Radio-Signals-from-Space

Radio Signal Classification refers to the classification of radio signals obtained from the outer space in the form of histograms into various categories. 
It uses 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. 
SETI stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. 
Radio Signal Classification as performed in the following implementation considers the spectrograms, obtained from the outer space, as images. 
Those images are then used to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes. 
Convolutional neural network has been used to classify signals from space. 
Thus, the Keras API has been used along with TensorFlow as its backend to build and train a neural network model to solve an image classification problem.
